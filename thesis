Introduction
	Help software development organisations to improve their code
		Develop a tool, enchance existing tool (why sonar? 
		Benefits: devs - improve code
			 project managers - see project overview
			data scientiests - enchanced the number of code smells that can be handled by sonarqube

	Extend body of knowledge about the occurence of code smells in Android applications
		Extend the number of code smells developed previously
		Provide analysis results
		Compare the results with my tools with published resulsts
		Additional results for code smells that are not yet avaialble in the ltierature
Related work
	- Code smells
	- Code smell analysis tools
KKethod (Critical)
	- describe tool and describe functionality of both tools
	- How is the tool implemented?
	- Describe datasets, why we chose the projects and how (also describe why some projects could not be analyzed)
	- What sort of analysis I will perform and how will I perform the analysis?
Analysis results (Critical)
	Orgnaize by goals and present examples for each subgoal (Screenshots, whatever) for each role
	Target groups, and how can they use the tool.
	
	Performed analysis on Androdi applications and now compare with already existing literatue
	
Conclussion



Also need to mention that I've only made claim that my tool works but I dont know if it actually helps.

Maybe there are some limitations with the dataset etc


By the end of January:
	All hadlines
		- Sub headlie
	
Finished all the practical work before March, be done by the end of Februrary
	
**IDEA**

Perform tool evaluation on someone (small empirical study)
